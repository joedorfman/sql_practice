SQL Practice
In my data science program, we had some exposure to SQL. To get some more practice in, I've connected to the Northwind sample database to run some intermediate level queries. Some of the queries were given to me by my instructor and a few of them I've added myself.

This implementation of the Northwind database is PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is a great implementation of SQL to learn, because it's very popular, it's free and open-source, and the skills are largely applicable to other implementations. I'm also using the sqlalchemy package in Python to query the database and displaying the data as a Pandas Dataframe. I've obfuscated the connection details in the code below, so unfortunately you will not be able to connect to the database yourself.

I hope you enjoy going through my work and as always, feel free to reach out to me with any questions via email (joedorfman@gmail.com).
